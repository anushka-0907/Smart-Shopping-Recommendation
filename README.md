# Smart Shopping Assistant — FashionMNIST

This project implements a **Smart Shopping Assistant** that utilizes image classification techniques to recognize clothing items from the FashionMNIST dataset. The goal is to simulate a shopping assistant that can identify fashion products and provide intelligent suggestions based on the identified item.

## Features

* **Image Classification** using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
* Identifies items from the FashionMNIST dataset (e.g., T-shirts, shoes, bags)
* Displays model training accuracy and loss
* Built using **TensorFlow/Keras**
* Includes model evaluation on test data
* Simple UI logic to simulate recommendation behavior based on prediction

## Project Structure

```
Smart_Shopping_Assistant_FashionMNIST.ipynb  # Main Jupyter notebook
README.md                                    # Project documentation
```

## Technologies Used

* Python 3.x
* TensorFlow / Keras
* Matplotlib / NumPy
* FashionMNIST dataset (from Keras datasets)

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository or download the `.ipynb` notebook.
2. Open the notebook using [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) or [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
3. Run all cells step-by-step to:

   * Load and preprocess the dataset
   * Train the CNN model
   * Evaluate and test predictions
   * Simulate item identification and recommendation

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/anushka-0907/smart-shopping-assistant.git
cd smart-shopping-assistant
```

## Model Performance

The model achieves decent accuracy (\~89–92%) on the test set, which is sufficient for a prototype assistant in fashion item recognition.
